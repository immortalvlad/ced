===========

CeD is a mobile web based fishing game. 
Players can make missions, compete, create and join fishing clubs and play in contests.

The game was built using Yii and Jquery Mobile frameworks.
At this time, the users can't join the game with registration, because the game is a part of another site, but this will be change.

The game's language is hungarian, now.
